# bushfire-model
Simple modelling of a bushfire spreading across a landscape represented as 2D grid. 

The spread of a fire is affected by the amount and type of fuel available (i.e. the bush and tree landscape), the land's slope, and wind direction.

The model will forecast the fire's damage inflicted before it burns out.

Files include:
- code that parses a given scenario
- code that determines when a cell starts burning
- code that puts the whole model together
- sample test cases
